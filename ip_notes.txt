PROBLEMS:
    FUNCTIONALITY:
        -star list page -- not loading starList items, it's throwing error
        -MAKE DRYER!!!!!

    LAYOUT:
        -LABELS - throwing input boxes way off, need to have them justified right
        



        





FUNCTIONALITY IDEAS:

    PRIMARY:
        -star list with hover feature to show correct conjugation of verb
        -MASTER THE VERB respondent must get verb right 3 times to be called mastered, 
        GET IT RIGHT got all answers correct atleast once, keep track in a bar or numbers
        -drop down menu to switch tenses, with a button to say "I'm ready" and then show "CHECK ANSWERS" and "SHOW NEXT VERB". Have
        text for io, tu, lui inputs in english until they pick the language/tenses


    SECONDARY: 
        -add portuguese, spanish, italian and english


    TERTIARY:
        -show the incorrect parts of the answer (maybe added on end after input box?)
        -show those verbs that the person got completely correct or 
        a bar? that they mastered or just got correct and the ones left?
        
        -ability for respondent to add new verb:
            -dropdown menu for tense
            -dropdown for language
            -inputs for (io, tu, lui etc)
         -"SKIP VERB" button to allow respondent to skip the verb but have it shown again later,
            just add back to verbListNotShown
        -ALERT if SHOW NEXT VERB button is clicked without getting all answers correct
            "press SKIP VERB or try again"



LAYOUT IDEAS:
    PRIMARY:
        -Change grid background color/border and banner based on language selected, maybe body too? 
        look for fading from one color to another or white to deeper color, pale color
        -GRID - LORO moved the input further away, should be same distance as other inputs
        -FINISHED VERB LIST MESSAGE - a little far from the grid
	    -VERB SECTION / NAV BAR - move to middle of image
    
    SECONDARY:
        -TITLE/EVERYTHING - how to make font-size respond to browser size?
        -NAV-BAR - when screen size is reduced enough, those elements are squished
        hamburger icon if screen gets small enough, or shrink font size or stack them
        -star List button make into a star
        -star list have the list in front of the respective flag for each language






LOOSE IDEAS:
    -what if I make the verb an class or each language? and each verb is an instance 






QUESTIONS:
*****What is the smartest way for me to start the next languages? 
    -Create diff object for spanish, italian etc? 
    -Create objects inside of one for language?
    -Create a class of each langauge or tense?




1. Why is translate verb input box the only one being hightlighted?



1. 

2. 

5. CSS question, showVerbSection display: inline does not put items inline. Why?
