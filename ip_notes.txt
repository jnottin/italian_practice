PROBLEMS:
    FUNCTIONALITY:
        -TRANSLATE VERB -- box is showing red with no text in it when CHECK ANSWERS button is pressed, 
        but conj inputs not unless i put text in Translate input
        -verbList and verbListNotShown need to be .map() to create new arrays from the object
        -MAKE DRYER!!!!!
            - CHECK INPUT - .value.lowerCase() for all 
            - UPDATE LISTS () - should I return a value there?

    LAYOUT:
        -GRID - center grid, there is something on the right side blocking it 
        check it out now haha what is going on? two colums is perfect, label and input in one column, grid gap still not working
        -CHECK BOXES - move to third column of grid
        



        





FUNCTIONALITY IDEAS:

    PRIMARY:
        -PRESS ENTER causes checkAnswers function to run, eventListener on ENTER?
        -SOME KEY maybe up? adds all answers to inputs
        -??MAYBE?? input box for whether verb is irr or reg
        -checkbox for if you want to see which boxes are irregular or regular, 
        maybe highlight background of input box?
        -"SKIP VERB" button to allow respondent to skip the verb but have it shown again later,
        just add back to verbListNotShown
        -ALERT if SHOW NEXT VERB button is clicked without getting all answers correct
        "press SKIP VERB or try again"
    

    SECONDARY: 
        -star button to save verb to starList
        -add portuguese, spanish, italian and english
        -MASTER THE VERB respondent must get verb right 3 times to be 
        taken out of running list, GET IT RIGHT got all answers correct atleast once.
        -drop down menu to switch tenses, with a button to say "I'm ready" and then show "CHECK ANSWERS" and "SHOW NEXT VERB". Have
        text for io, tu, lui inputs in english until they pick the language/tenses
        -show those verbs that the person got completely correct or 
        a bar? that they mastered or just got correct and the ones left?
        -have a button for only reg or irregular verbs


    TERTIARY:
        -show the incorrect parts of the answer (maybe added on end after input box?)
        -star list with hover feature to show correct conjugation of verb
        
        -ability for respondent to add new verb:
            -dropdown menu for tense
            -dropdown for language
            -inputs for (io, tu, lui etc)




LAYOUT IDEAS:
    PRIMARY:
        -Change grid background color/border and banner based on language selected, maybe body too? 
        look for fading from one color to another or white to deeper color, pale color
        -GRID - LORO moved the input further away, should be same distance as other inputs
        -FINISHED VERB LIST MESSAGE - a little far from the grid
	    -VERB SECTION / NAV BAR - move to middle of image
    
    SECONDARY:
        -TITLE/EVERYTHING - how to make font-size respond to browser size?
        -NAV-BAR - when screen size is reduced enough, those elements are squished
        hamburger icon if screen gets small enough, or shrink font size or stack them
        -star List button make into a star
        -star list have the list in front of the respective flag for each language






LOOSE IDEAS:
    -what if I make the verb an class or each language? and each verb is an instance 






QUESTIONS:
*****What is the smartest way for me to start the next languages? 
    -Create diff object for spanish, italian etc? 
    -Create objects inside of one for language?
    -Create a class of each langauge or tense?




1. Why is translate verb input box the only one being hightlighted?



1. 

2. 

5. CSS question, showVerbSection display: inline does not put items inline. Why?
