PROBLEMS:
    FUNCTIONALITY:
	-BROKE THE MOTHERFUCKERRRRRRR!!! It has to do with checking Reg verbs or Irr verbs check box -- PRESENT TENSE IS WORKING, not past or future, i think it has to do with setting the tense.


        -Portu Ser is not cheking answers
        -Work on graphics
        -disable star list button until starList =1 or more
        -get verb tenses to work -- GOTTA DEFINE LANGUAGE BEFORE TENSES, disable tenses before language is picked, 
        give language a red shadow or something when page is loaded, then shown tenses after. Do not load new verb or enable other buttons until tense is decided. Language can be changed as much as they would like
	    -at Reset Verbs hide "Verb to conjugate..." and "Star This Verb" button
        -star list section -- real time update and when starList is showing, make button gold, if someone changes star for verb and starList is "on" then call updateStarList, 
        -PHONE SIZE / adjust to screen size-- make it phone size
        -MAKE DRYER!!!!!

    LAYOUT:
        -FINISHED VERB -- need to hide h3Insert and star this button
        



        





FUNCTIONALITY IDEAS:

    PRIMARY:
        -star list with hover feature to show correct conjugation of verb
        -MASTER THE VERB respondent must get verb right 3 times to be called mastered, 
        GET IT RIGHT got all answers correct atleast once, keep track in a bar or numbers
        -drop down menu to switch tenses, with a button to say "I'm ready" and then show "CHECK ANSWERS" and "SHOW NEXT VERB". Have
        text for io, tu, lui inputs in english until they pick the language/tenses


    SECONDARY: 
        -add portuguese, spanish, italian and english


    TERTIARY:
        -show the incorrect parts of the answer (maybe added on end after input box?)
        -show those verbs that the person got completely correct or 
        a bar? that they mastered or just got correct and the ones left?
        
        -ability for respondent to add new verb:
            -dropdown menu for tense
            -dropdown for language
            -inputs for (io, tu, lui etc)
         -"SKIP VERB" button to allow respondent to skip the verb but have it shown again later,
            just add back to verbListNotShown
        -ALERT if SHOW NEXT VERB button is clicked without getting all answers correct
            "press SKIP VERB or try again"



LAYOUT IDEAS:
    PRIMARY:
        -Change grid background color/border and banner based on language selected, maybe body too? 
        look for fading from one color to another or white to deeper color, pale color
        -GRID - LORO moved the input further away, should be same distance as other inputs
        -FINISHED VERB LIST MESSAGE - a little far from the grid
	    -VERB SECTION / NAV BAR - move to middle of image
    
    SECONDARY:
        -TITLE/EVERYTHING - how to make font-size respond to browser size?
        -NAV-BAR - when screen size is reduced enough, those elements are squished
        hamburger icon if screen gets small enough, or shrink font size or stack them
        -star List button make into a star
        -star list have the list in front of the respective flag for each language






LOOSE IDEAS:
    -what if I make the verb an class or each language? and each verb is an instance 






QUESTIONS:
*****What is the smartest way for me to start the next languages? 
    -Create diff object for spanish, italian etc? 
    -Create objects inside of one for language?
    -Create a class of each langauge or tense?




1. What does "Responsive" view mean in the inspect looking at changing screen sizes?

2. Why is StarList appearing where it is?
