PROBLEMS:
    FUNCTIONALITY:
        -"RESET VERB LIST" button is clicked (hidden normally):
            -DONE -- reset button for end of verbsShownList, 
            -is hidden normally, hides or disables "SHOW NEW VERB" and "CHECK MY ANSWERS" button when shown
            -DONE -- shown at end of verbsNotShownList
        -TRANSLATE INPUT -- needs to be check and given same borders as other input_boxes

    LAYOUT:
        -GRID - center grid and reduce width on each side
        -CHECK MY ANSWERS and SHOW NEW VERB buttons should be styled more


        





FUNCTIONALITY IDEAS:

    PRIMARY:
        -insert english verb translation box
        -whether verb is irr or reg
        -checkbox for if you want to see which boxes are irregular or regular
        -check box for showing only reg verbs or irreg verbs
        -"SKIP VERB" button to allow respondent to skip the verb but have it shown again later
        -ALERT if SHOW NEXT VERB button is clicked without getting all answers correct
    

    SECONDARY: 
        -star button to save verb to starList
        -MASTER THE VERB respondent must get verb right 3 times to be 
        taken out of running list, GET IT RIGHT got all answers correct atleast once.
        -drop down menu to switch tenses, with a button to say "I'm ready" and then show "CHECK ANSWERS" and "SHOW NEXT VERB". Have
        text for io, tu, lui inputs in english until they pick the language/tenses
        -show those verbs that the person got completely correct or 
        a bar? that they mastered or just got correct and the ones left?
        -have a button for only reg or irregular verbs


    TERTIARY:
        -show the incorrect parts of the answer
        
        -ability for respondent to add new verb:
            -dropdown menu for tense
            -dropdown for language
            -inputs for (io, tu, lui etc)




LAYOUT IDEAS:
    PRIMARY:
        -Change grid background color/border based on language selected
        -GRID - LORO moved the input further away
    
    SECONDARY:
        -TITLE - how to make font-size respond to browser size?
        -NAV-BAR - when screen size is reduced enough, those elements are squished
        -FINISHED VERBS TEXT - too spaced out and then squished SHOW NEW VERB BUTTON
        -Hamburger icon if screen gets small enough, or shrink font size or stack them






LOOSE IDEAS:
    -what if I make the verb an class or each language? and each verb is an instance 






QUESTIONS:

1. 
    //??how can i get this to work, it's something like this
    // var input_boxes = ["io", "tu", "lui", "noi", "voi", "loro"];
    // for (var i = 0; i < input_boxes.length; i++) {
    //   input_boxes[i]_input = document.querySelector("myText").value;
    // }


2. a. "getting values from boxes" the io_input, tu_input etc why can this not be outside of the checkAnswers() function?
    b. can I add toLowerCase to some other line to condense a little? 


3. why is querySelectorAll not working for clearing all input values?

4. button RESET VERB LIST, i put var verbListNotShown = verbList; it seems like that is makeing verblist lose verbs 
from SHOW NEW VERB but verbListNotShown should be the one losing verbs. Now i have to duplicate the array everywhere

5. CSS question, showVerbSection display: inline does not put items inline. Why?
